# TBD_UserEvaluation
I am implementing my own system to test in my User Evaluation course. It is a Mindfullness app developed in Unity that will be exported to mobile, desktop and XR. Will do C/A and C/B testing (VR being C, the baseline) to look for a relationship between the device used and the User Experience. A heuristics evaluation will be made. The data will be analyzed using R and all the results will be out-together on reserch documentation.

## Technololgies
+ Oculus VR sdk
+ Unity input system
+ Particle system for exercise's state visualization

## Cool things
+ Implemented state machine to switch between Inhaling, Holding, Exhaling...in the exercises
+ Uses Event delegates to trigger actions after timers finish
+ Will work in Android, Oculus Quest2 and Desktop
